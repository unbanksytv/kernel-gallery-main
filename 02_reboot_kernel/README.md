# Example: Reboot Kernel

In this kernel, we begin to examine the control flow of
the kernel and learn how to mark the kernel for reboot at runtime.

## Running the example

First, compile the kernel to WASM with Cargo:
<!-- $MDX skip -->
```sh
$ cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Then you can execute the kernel locally against the provided inputs (empty in this example) and commands:
```sh
$ octez-smart-rollup-wasm-debugger \
> ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/reboot_kernel.wasm \
> --inputs ./inputs.json \
> --commands ./commands.json
Loaded 0 inputs at level 0
Hello from kernel!

```

Additionally, you can omit the `--commands` flag to enter a REPL mode and
explore the execution of the kernel interactively. Try it out!
