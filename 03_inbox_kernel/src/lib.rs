// This kernel demonstrates how to parse the different kinds of inbox messages.
// The rollups inbox is the mechanism by which the Layer 1 can send messages to
// rollups. These can be:
// - Internal messages: sent by the Layer 1 itself, either:
//   - as a result of a smart contract making a transfer to a rollup address, or
//   - status messages from the protocol (such as the start or end of a new block level)
// - External messages: sent by anyone via a new kind of Layer 1 operation. These can
// include any kind of data, as defined by the kernel.

// The `read_inbox_message` function shows how to parse all of these messages,
// but more detailed handling of internal transfer messages and external
// messages is shown in the `filtering-kernel` and `outbox-kernel` examples.
// It is also important to keep in mind that the rollups inbox is shared among
// all deployed rollups, meaning that we should check whether a message is
// intended for us before processing it. For simplicity, this kernel skips over
// these checks, but they are also demonstrated in the aforementioned examples.

fn read_inbox_message<Expr: Michelson>(host: &mut impl Runtime) {
    // In this example, we are using an infinite loop, breaking only when
    // we reach the end of the inbox. In practice, we would need to be
    // mindful of how many ticks the processing of each kind of message takes.
    // We must be careful to benchmark the execution of our kernel and set a conservative
    // limit on how many messages the kernel can process before marking it for
    // reboot. See [https://tezos.gitlab.io/alpha/smart_rollups.html#developing-wasm-kernels]
    // for more details.
