# Example: Storage Kernel

In this example, we take a first look writing and reading to persistent storage.

Additionally, we introduce the Mock Host to enable a simple unit test of our kernel.

## Running the example

Run the unit test with `cargo test`:

<!-- $MDX skip -->
```sh
$ cargo test
```

To run the kernel locally, compile the kernel to WASM with Cargo:
<!-- $MDX skip -->
```sh
$ cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Then you can execute the kernel against the provided inputs (empty in this example) and commands:
```sh
$ octez-smart-rollup-wasm-debugger \
> ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/storage_kernel.wasm \
> --inputs ./inputs.json \
> --commands ./commands.json
